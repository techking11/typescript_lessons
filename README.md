# Learning TypeScript

Welcome to the TypeScript learning guide! This guide is designed for students who are new to TypeScript and want to learn it in a structured and engaging way.

## What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that adds static types. It helps developers catch errors early, improves code quality, and provides better tooling with IDEs and editors. TypeScript compiles down to plain JavaScript, which runs anywhere JavaScript is supported.

## Why Learn TypeScript?

- **Static Typing**: TypeScript provides a way to define types, which helps catch errors before runtime.
- **Better Tooling**: Features like autocompletion, type-checking, and better refactoring help make development faster and easier.
- **Large-Scale Applications**: TypeScript is ideal for building complex, large-scale applications due to its robust feature set.
- **Community & Adoption**: TypeScript is widely adopted by companies like Microsoft, Google, and Facebook.

## Prerequisites

Before starting with TypeScript, it's helpful to have a basic understanding of:

- **JavaScript**: Since TypeScript builds on top of JavaScript, understanding JavaScript basics is essential.
- **HTML/CSS** (optional but helpful): TypeScript is often used in web development alongside HTML and CSS.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Install TypeScript

To start using TypeScript, you need to install it. If you already have Node.js installed, you can install TypeScript using npm (Node Package Manager):

```bash
npm install -g typescript
```
